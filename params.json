If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me not a beer in return.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIt was under GNU/GPL copyleft license.  But since I changed it for a NOT-A-BEER-WARE LICENSE.  So you can still FEEL FREE TO USE AND IMPROVE IT, and also you can BUY ME A DRINK !!\r\n\r\n## NOTES\r\nI got this thesis template from Charles Chapple, who probably save my thesis whith it.  I'll probably never be able to thank him enough.\r\nThis thesis template has been adapted from that of Sergi Castellano and Domenec Farre, with bits and pieces of Enrique Blanco's thrown in.  All of these were derived from the original templates written by Robert Castelo and Sergio Mendoza.  At some point during this process, Josep Abril got involved and, according to one of the previous people, who knew him, probably rewrote the whole thing. And I also did the same ;-)\r\n\r\n## myOwnThesis\r\nIf you want to see my own thesis made with this template, go to [github.com/MaxUlysse/myOwnThesis](https://github.com/MaxUlysse/myOwnThesis)",

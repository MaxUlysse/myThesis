I'll probably never be able to thank him enough.\r\nThis thesis template has been adapted from that of Sergi Castellano and Domenec Farre, with bits and pieces of Enrique Blanco's thrown in.  All of these were derived from the original templates written by Robert Castelo and Sergio Mendoza.  At some point during this process, Josep Abril got involved and, according to one of the previous people, who knew him, probably rewrote the whole thing. And I also did the same ;-)\r\n\r\n### License\r\n```\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"THE NOT-A-BEER-WARE LICENSE\" (Revision 42):\r\n<max@ithake.eu> wrote this file.
